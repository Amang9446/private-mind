Private Mind represents a new era of AI—powerful, personal, and completely offline. Built around the belief that AI should live entirely on your device, Private Mind opens the door to a new kind of experience: fast, secure, and fully private.

All conversations happen locally, with no data sent to the cloud and no internet connection required. There are no sign-ups, no subscriptions, and no hidden costs—just intelligent, customizable AI available anytime, anywhere.

## Key Features

- **Fully Private & Secure**: All conversations and data stay on your device. Nothing is collected or shared.
- **Free & Accessible**: Use advanced AI models without subscriptions, accounts, or paywalls.
- **Customizable AI**: Choose from supported models or upload your own. Tailor system prompts and model behavior to fit your needs.
- **Built-in Benchmarks**: Test and compare models based on performance, memory use, and speed—optimized for your hardware.
- **Offline by Design**: Every feature works without an internet connection. Download models once, and use them on the go.
